## Config 🔧

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Starting here is written for developers and regular contributors can skip

We now have 3 configuration files, 

one is in `/lang/en.json`, which is the source text of i18n, 

one is in `/app.config.ts`, which is the configuration file of the element content, such as setting ICONS/images somewhere, 

and one is `/nuxt.config.ts`, This is the configuration file for the entire project, and generally you only need to change the configuration in runtimeConfig

There are usually comments in the configuration file to tell you how to fill it out, please note

If you need to change the theme color, go to `/assets/css/main.css`

### How to add new i18n language

In the repository, all you need to do is add a new language as follows in i18n of `nuxt.config.ts`

```ts
  i18n: {
    locales: [
      {
        code: '[Language code, such as en/ja]',
        file: '[The character entered in code].json',
      },
    ],
  },
```

Then you need to add the corresponding language to data() in `<script>` 在 `components/NavBar.vue` as follows

```json

languages: [
        {
          lang: "en",
          name: "English",
          flag: "twa-flag-united-states"
        }, {
          lang: "ja",
          name: "日本語",
          flag: "twa-flag-japan"
        },{
          lang: "[Language code, such as en/ja]",
          name: "[Language name]",
          flag: "[twitter national flags, such as twa-flag-united states for the flag of the United States]"
        },
      ]

```

Then go to crowdin and add the appropriate language
